## Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

* `scripts` are tools to automatically generate content.
* `docs` are various files used to prepare other files, but not directly published themselves.
* `temppage` a minimal site we had online while developing the full web page.
* `web` is a snapshot of the actual site, which we would sync with the ACM web server.

Within `web`:

* All publicly-visible pages are a .php in the top-level directory. Subdirectories contain something included in one way or another.

* `css`			CSS code. Only edit style.css, the rest is 3rd party.
* `css/images`	jquerymobile CSS images
* `images`		Our images (logos, etc.)
* `include`		PHP partials and code. Note especially `menu.php` which defines the navigation bar links to the various pages on the site. Make sure to update Google analytics info at `footer.php` and the latest social widgets at `socialbtn.php`.
* `include/program`	Program listings, auto-generated by `scripts/proggen`.
* `js`			Javascript. Only edit script.js, the rest is 3rd party libraries.
* `files`		Static documents served by the site: the calls for papers, PDF of the conference schedule, etc.
* `doc`         More static documents.

The site uses a bunch of 3rd party javascript libraries. You will want to use their latest versions:

* http://jquery.com/ - the javascript goes into `js`
* http://jquerymobile.com/ - the javascript goes into `js` and the CSS and images go into `css`
* http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css - the CSS for the jquerymobile documentation page, goes into CSS
* http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ - the javascript goes into `js`
